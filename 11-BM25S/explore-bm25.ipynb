      "An aluminum can (British English: aluminium can) is a single-use container for packaging made primarily of aluminum.\n",
      "It is commonly used for food and beverages such as olives and soup but also for products such as oil, chemicals, and other liquids. Global production is 180 billion annually and constitutes the largest single use of aluminum globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Usage ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Use of aluminum in cans began in 1957. Aluminum offers greater malleability, resulting in ease of manufacture; this gave rise to the two-piece can, where all but the top of the can is simply stamped out of a single piece of aluminum, rather than constructed from two pieces of steel. The inside of the can is lined by spray coating an epoxy lacquer or polymer to protect the aluminum from being corroded by acidic contents such as carbonated beverages and imparting a metallic taste to the beverage. The epoxy may contain bisphenol A. A label is either printed directly on the side of the can or will be glued to the outside of the curved surface, indicating its contents.\n",
      "Most aluminum cans are made of two pieces.  The bottom and body are \"drawn\" or \"drawn and ironed\" from a flat plate or shallow cup.  After filling, the can \"end\" is sealed onto the top of the can. This is supplemented by a sealing compound to ensure that the top is air tight.\n",
      "The advantages of aluminum over steel (tinplate) cans include;\n",
      "\n",
      "light weight\n",
      "competitive cost\n",
      "usage of easy-open aluminum ends: no need for a can opener\n",
      "clean appearance\n",
      "aluminum does not rust\n",
      "easy to press into shape\n",
      "The easy-open aluminum end for beverage cans was developed by Alcoa in 1962 for the Pittsburgh Brewing Company and is now used in nearly all of the canned beer market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Recycling ==\n",
      "Aluminum cans can be made with recycled aluminum. In 2017, 3.8 million tons of aluminum were generated in the US of which 0.62 million tons were recycled - a recycling rate of 16%. According to estimates from the Aluminum Association, a large amount of aluminium remains unrecycled in the US, where roughly $700 million worth of cans end up in landfills each year.   In 2012, 92% of the aluminum beverage cans sold in Switzerland were recycled. Cans are the most recycled beverage container, at a rate of 69% worldwide.\n",
      "One issue is that the top of the can is made from a blend of aluminum and magnesium to increase its strength. When the can is melted for recycling, the mixture is unsuitable for either the top or the bottom/side. Instead of mixing recycled metal with more aluminum (to soften it) or magnesium (to harden it), a new approach uses annealing to produce an alloy that works for both.\n",
      "The aluminum can is also considered the most valuable recyclable material in an average recycling bin. It is estimated that Americans throw away nearly 1 billion dollars a year in wasted aluminum. The aluminum industry pays nearly 800 million dollars a year for recycled aluminum since it is so versatile.\n",
      "Because of the advantages of aluminium packaging (shelf life, durability, food grade factor) over plastics, it is considered an alternative to PET bottles, with the possibility of replacing the majority of them in the next decades.\n",

      "== Cans as collectibles ==\n",
      "Some people collect cans as a hobby. Can collections can be exclusive to one sector only, eg., some collectors may collect soda cans only, while others may dedicate themselves to collecting beer cans or oil cans exclusively, but some collectors may collect cans regardless of the type of can. \n",
      "One aspect that may make someone interested in building a can collection as a hobby is the variety of cans available worldwide promoting such things as films, musical albums and tours, sporting teams and events, countries, ideals and even some non-food or petrol-oriented brands and companies.\n",
      "Celebrities can also be featured on collectible cans; such was the case of tennis player Andre Agassi, who had a set of four Pepsi Max soda cans dedicated to him in 1996.\n",
      "Davide Andreani of Italy is in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the largest collection of soda cans of one specific brand in the world, with over 20,000 cans in his collection. According to a website named canmuseum.com, the largest collection of Pepsi Cola cans belongs to Chris Cavaletti, also of Italy, who owned 12,402 Pepsi Cola cans from 81 countries as of 2022, while the largest collection of Coca-Cola soda cans belonged to Gary Feng of Canada with 11,308 variations of the Coca-Cola cans from 108 countries collected, with William B. Christensen of the United States owning the largest collection of beer cans with 75,000 from 125 countries and Allan Green, of the United States also, with the largest collection of wine cans, at 449.\n",

      "Article for Drink can:\n",
      "A drink can (or beverage can) is a metal container designed to hold a fixed portion of liquid such as carbonated soft drinks, alcoholic drinks, fruit juices, teas, herbal teas, energy drinks, etc. Drink cans are made of aluminum (75% of worldwide production) or tin-plated steel (25% worldwide production). Worldwide production for all drink cans is approximately 370 billion cans per year.\n",
      "\n",

      "== History ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The first commercial beer available in cans began in 1935 in Richmond, Virginia. Not long after that, sodas, with their higher acidity and somewhat higher pressures, were available in cans. The key development for storing drinks in cans was the interior liner, typically plastic or sometimes a waxy substance, that helped to keep the product's flavor from being ruined by a chemical reaction with the metal. Another major factor for the timing was the repeal of Prohibition in the United States at the end of 1933.\n",
      "In 1935, the Felinfoel Brewery at Felinfoel in Wales was the first brewery outside the US to commercially can beer. Prior to this time, beer had been available only in barrels or in glass bottles. From this time, lightweight tin cans could be used. Felinfoel was a major supplier to British armed forces abroad in the Second World War. Cans saved a great deal of space and weight for wartime exports compared to glass bottles and did not have to be returned for refilling. These early cans did not have a pull tab, being equipped instead with a crown cork (beer bottle top). From the 18th century until the early 20th century Wales dominated world tinplate production, peaking in the early 1890s when 80% of the world's tinplate was produced in south Wales.\n",
      "Canned drinks were factory-sealed and required a special opener tool in order to consume the contents. Cans were typically formed as cylinders, having a flat top and bottom. They required a can piercer, colloquially known as a \"church key\", that latched onto the top rim for leverage; lifting the handle would force the sharp tip through the top of the can, cutting a triangular hole. A smaller second hole was usually punched at the opposite side of the top to admit air while pouring, allowing the liquid to flow freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mid-1930s, some cans were developed with caps so that they could be opened and poured more like a bottle. These were called \"cone tops\", as their tops had a conical taper up to the smaller diameter of the cap. Cone top cans were sealed by the same crimped caps that were put on bottles, and could be opened with the same bottle-opener tool. There were three types of conetops: high profile, low profile, and j-spout. The low profile and j-spout were the earliest, dating from about 1935. The \"crowntainer\" was a different type of can that was drawn steel with a bottom cap. These were developed by Crown Cork & Seal (now known as Crown Holdings, Inc.), a leading drink packaging and drink can producer. The popularity of canned drinks was slow to catch on, as the metallic taste was difficult to overcome with the interior liner not perfected, especially with more acidic sodas. Cans had two advantages over glass bottles. First for the distributors, flat-top cans were more compact for transportation and storage and weighed less than bottles. Second for consumers, they did not require the deposit typically paid for bottles, as they were discarded after use. Glass-bottle deposits were reimbursed when consumers took the empties back to the store.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1959, the recyclable aluminum can was introduced to the market in a 7 oz. size by the Adolph Coors Company.\n",
      "In 2008, an aluminum version of the crowntainer design was adopted for packaging Coca-Cola's Caribou Coffee drink.\n",

      "== Composition ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Most metal drink cans manufactured in the United States are made of aluminum, whereas in some parts of Europe and Asia approximately 55 percent are made of steel and 45 percent are aluminum alloy. Steel cans often have a top made of aluminum. Beverage containers are made of two different aluminum alloys. The body is made of the 3004 alloy that can be drawn easily and the top is made of the harder 5182 alloy.\n",
      "In 2001, the Australian Aluminium Council reported that the average Australian-size can weighed approximately 14.9 grams (0.53 oz).  Improved manufacturing techniques had allowed Australian manufacturers to reduce metal requirements from the 1992 average of 16.55 grams (0.584 oz). In 2011, an empty U.S.-size can weighed approximately one-half ounce (14 g), with approximately 34 per pound or 70 per kilogram.\n",
      "In many parts of the world a deposit can be recovered by turning in empty plastic, glass, and aluminum containers. Scrap metal dealers often purchase aluminum cans in bulk, even when deposits are not offered. Aluminum is one of the most cost-effective materials to recycle. When recycled without other metals being mixed in, the can–lid combination is perfect for producing new stock for the main part of the can—the loss of magnesium during melting is made up for by the high magnesium content of the lid. Also, reducing ores such as bauxite into aluminum requires large amounts of electricity, making recycling cheaper than producing new metal.\n",
      "Aluminum cans are coated internally to protect the aluminum from oxidizing. Despite this coating, trace amounts of aluminum can be degraded into the liquid, the amount depending on factors such as storage temperature and liquid composition. Chemical compounds used in the internal coating of the can include types of epoxy resin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Fabrication process ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern cans are generally produced through a mechanical cold forming process that starts with punching a flat blank from very stiff cold-rolled sheet. This sheet is typically alloy 3104-H19 or 3004-H19, which is aluminum with about 1% manganese and 1% magnesium to give it strength and formability. The flat blank is first formed into a cup about three inches in diameter. This cup is then pushed through a different forming process called \"ironing\" which forms the can. The bottom of the can is also shaped at this time. The malleable metal deforms into the shape of an open-top can. With the sophisticated technology of the dies and the forming machines, the side of the can is thinner than either the top and bottom areas, where stiffness is required.\n",
      "Plain lids (known as shells) are stamped from a coil of aluminum, typically alloy 5182-H48, and transferred to another press that converts them to easy-open ends. This press is known as a conversion press which forms an integral rivet button in the lid and scores the opening, while concurrently forming the tabs in another die from a separate strip of aluminum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Filling cans ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Cans are filled before the top is crimped on by seamers. To speed up the production process filling and sealing operations need to be extremely precise. The filling head centers the can using gas pressure, purges the air, and lets the drink flow down the sides of the can. The lid is placed on the can, and then crimped in two operations. A seaming head engages the lid from above while a seaming roller to the side curls the edge of the lid around the edge of the can body. The head and roller spin the can in a complete circle to seal all the way around. Then a pressure roller with a different profile drives the two edges together under pressure to make a gas-tight seal. Filled cans usually have pressurized gas inside, which makes them stiff enough for easy handling. Without the riveted tab the scored section of the can's end would be impossible to lift from the can.\n",
      "Can filling lines come in different line speeds from 15,000 cans per hour (cph) up to 120,000 cph or more, all with different levels of automation. For example, lid feeding alone starts with manual debagging onto a simple v-chute connected to the seamer up to fully automated processes with automatic debagging and lid feeding of lids combined with automatic roll depalletizers for filling debaggers by robots.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Opening mechanisms ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Early metal drink cans had no tabs; they were opened by a can-piercer or churchkey, a device resembling a bottle opener with a sharp point. The can was opened by punching two triangular holes in the lid—a large one for drinking, and a second smaller one to admit air.\n",
      "As early as 1922, inventors were applying for patents on cans with tab tops, but the technology of the time made these inventions impractical. Later advancements saw the ends of the can made out of aluminum instead of steel.\n",
      "In 1959, Ermal Fraze devised a can-opening method that would come to dominate the canned drink market. His invention was the \"pull-tab\". This eliminated the need for a separate opener tool by attaching an aluminum pull-ring lever with a rivet to a pre-scored wedge-shaped tab section of the can top. The ring was riveted to the center of the top, which created an elongated opening large enough that one hole simultaneously served to let the drink flow out while air flowed in. \n",
      "Previously, while on a family picnic, Mr. Fraze had forgotten to bring a can opener and was forced to use a car bumper to open a can of beer. Thinking there must be an easier way, he stayed up all night until he came up with the pull tab. Pull-tab cans, or the discarded tabs from them, were colloquially called \"pop-tops\".\n",
      "Into the 1970s the pull-tab was widely popular, but its popularity came with the problem of people frequently simply discarding the pull-tabs on the ground, creating a potential injury risk especially to the feet or fingers. In the 1960s, at least one inventor attempted to solve the litter problem, by having the tab be retained by a stationary key that would wrap the tab around itself, which was unsuccessful commercially.\n",
      "The problem of the discarded tops was initially solved by the invention of the push-tab. Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up; instead, the raised aluminum blister was pushed down into the can using one finger. A small unscored section of the tab prevented it from detaching and falling into the can after being pushed in. Push-tabs never gained wide popularity because while they had solved the litter problem of the pull-tab, they created a safety hazard where the person's finger upon pushing the tab into the can was immediately exposed to the sharp edges of the opening. A feature of the push-tab Coors Beer cans was that they had a second, smaller, push-tab at the top as an airflow vent. \"Push-tabs\" were introduced into Australia from around 1977 and were locally known as \"pop-tops\", before being replaced later by the Stay-on-tab. The safety and litter problems were eventually solved later in the 1970s with Daniel F. Cudzik's invention of the non-removing \"Stay-Tab\".\n",
      "Cans are usually in sealed paperboard cartons, corrugated fiberboard boxes, or trays covered with plastic film. The entire distribution system and packaging need to be controlled to ensure freshness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Pop-tab ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Mikolaj Kondakow and James Wong of Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada invented the pull tab version for bottles in or before 1951 (Canadian patent 476789). In 1962, Ermal Cleon Fraze of Dayton, Ohio, United States, invented the similar integral rivet and pull-tab version (also known as ring pull in British English), which had a ring attached at the rivet for pulling, and which would come off completely to be discarded. He received US Patent No. 3,349,949 for his pull-top can design in 1963 and licensed his invention to Alcoa and Pittsburgh Brewing Company, the latter of which first introduced the design on Iron City Beer cans. The first soft drinks to be sold in all-aluminum cans were R.C. Cola and Diet-Rite Cola, both made by the Royal Crown Cola company, in 1964.\n",
      "The early pull-tabs detached easily. In 1976, the Journal of the American Medical Association noted cases of children ingesting pull-tabs that had broken off and dropped into the can.\n",

His patent expired in 1975 and has been directly cited in the mechanisms used by companies such as Crown Cork & Seal Co., Broken Hill Proprietary Co., and United States Steel Corporation. Approximately one month after Bajada's patent expired, Daniel F. Cudzik, an engineer with Reynolds Metals, filed a design patent application for an \"End closure for a container\". This later became known as a \"Sta-Tab\". When the Sta-Tab launched in 1975, on Falls City beer and, quickly, other drinks, there was an initial period of consumer testing and education. Cudzik later received patents for this \"Easy Open Wall\" (US 3967752, issued 1976-07-06  US 3967753, issued 1976-07-06 ). The validity of these patents was upheld in subsequent litigation.\n",
      "The similarly designed \"Easy-open ecology end\" was invented by Ermal Fraze and Omar Brown. Its patent application was also filed in 1975, less than two months after the expiration of Bajada's patent. This design, like Cudzik's, uses a separate tab attached to the upper surface as a lever to depress a scored part of the lid, which folds underneath the top of the can and out of the way of the resulting opening, thus reducing injuries and roadside litter caused by removable tabs.\n",
      "Such \"retained ring-pull\" cans supplanted pull-off tabs in the United Kingdom in 1989 for soft drinks and 1990 for alcoholic drinks.\n",
      "The Stay-On-Tab (SOT) opening system resolved the ecological problem of the previous pull-tab system. It opened up another issue, still unresolved today, about hygiene: today the outside panel of the tab goes inside the can, sinking in the liquid.\n",
      "One of the more recent modifications to can design was the introduction of the \"wide mouth\" can in the late 1990s. The American Can Company, now a part of Rexam, and Coors Brewing Company have owned wide mouth design patent (number D385,192) since 1997. Other companies have similar designs for the wide mouth. Ball Corporation's from 2008 has a vent tube to allow direct airflow into the can reducing the number of gulps during the pour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Press button can ===\n",
      "One variation was the press button can, which featured two pre-cut buttons—one small and one large—in the top of the can sealed with a plastic membrane. These buttons were held closed by the outward pressure of the carbonated drink. The consumer would open the can by depressing both buttons, which would result in two holes. The small hole would act as a vent to relieve internal pressure so the larger button could then be pressed down to create the hole used for consuming the drink. Consumers could also easily cut themselves on the edges of the holes or get their fingers stuck.\n",
      "Press button cans were used by Pepsi in Canada from the 1970s to 1980s and Coors in the 1970s. They have since been replaced with pull tabs. Used in Australia, locally known as \"pop-tops\", for soft drinks from 1977 to the early 1980s. However, Heineken Brewery did bring back press- or push button cans on the market in Europe as a short-lived marketing strategy in the 1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Full aperture end ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Another variation on the drink can is the \"full aperture end\", where the entire lid can be removed – turning an aluminum can into a cup. Crown Holdings first designed the \"360 End\" for use by SABMiller at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. It has been used by Anheuser-Busch InBev in China and Brazil and by the Sly Fox Brewing Company in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Resealable lid ===\n",
      "Another variation on the drink can is to have a resealable lid. A version patented by Cogito Can in France has been used by Groupe Casino, the French grocery chain for its private label energy drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Recycling ==\n",
      "The beverage can be recycled, and clean aluminum has residual market value, but recycled cans still need to be diluted by up to 50% virgin aluminum because the sides and tops of the can are of different alloys. The acronym UBC, for used beverage container, is employed by such companies as Apple, Inc for reference to the material of its portable laptop cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Design ==\n",
      "Most large companies serve their beverages in printed cans, where designs are printed on the aluminum and then crafted into a can. Alternatively, cans can be wrapped with a plastic design, mimicking the printed can but allowing for more flexibility than printed cans. A modern-day trend in craft alcohol is to design stickers to put on cans, allowing for smaller batches and quick changes for new flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Collecting ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Beer can collecting was a minor fad in the late 1970s and 1990s. However, the hobby waned rapidly in popularity. The Beer Can Collectors of America (BCCA), founded in 1970, was an organization supporting the hobby, but has now renamed itself Brewery Collectibles Club of America to be more modern.\n",
      "As of late 2009, membership in the Brewery Collectibles Club of America was 3,570, down from a peak of 11,954 in 1978. Just 19 of the members were under the age of 30, and the members' average age had increased to 59.\n",

      "Oil cans were made by companies like Noera Manufacturing Company and Perfection in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Around this time, oil cans frequently leaked and contributed to fires. In 1957, aluminium oil cans were introduced, produced by companies like the American Can Company.\n",

      "Article for Steel and tin cans:\n",
      "A steel can, tin can, tin (especially in British English, Australian English, Canadian English and South African English), or can is a  container made of thin metal, for distribution or storage of goods. Some cans are opened by removing the top panel with a can opener or other tool; others have covers removable by hand without a tool. Cans can store a broad variety of contents: food, beverages, oil, chemicals, etc. In a broad sense, any metal container is sometimes called a \"tin can\", even if it is made, for example, of aluminium.\n",
      "Steel cans were traditionally made of tinplate; the tin coating stopped the contents from rusting the steel. Tinned steel is still used, especially for fruit juices and pale canned fruit. Modern cans are often made from steel lined with transparent films made from assorted plastics, instead of tin. Early cans were often soldered with neurotoxic high-lead solders. High-lead solders were banned in the 1990s in the United States, but smaller amounts of lead were still often present in both the solder used to seal cans and in the mostly-tin linings.\n",
      "Cans are highly recyclable and around 65% of steel cans are recycled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== History ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The tin canning process was conceived by the Frenchman Philippe de Girard, who had British merchant Peter Durand patent the idea in 1810.  The canning concept was based on experimental food preservation work in glass containers the year before by the French inventor Nicholas Appert. Durand did not pursue food canning, but, in 1812, sold his patent to two Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product, and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London.  By 1813 they were producing their first tin canned goods for the Royal Navy. By 1820, tin canisters or cans were being used for gunpowder, seeds, and turpentine.\n",
      "Early tin cans were sealed by soldering with a tin–lead alloy, which could lead to lead poisoning. Automated soldering machines started to arrive in 1870s The steel started to displace iron as a material for the cans at the very end of the 19th century. Locking side seam was invented by Max Ams in 1888, giving the rise to a \"sanitary can\" design, where the solder was found only on the outside of the can and never touched the food. The modern three-piece design dates back to 1904 (Sanitary Can Company of New York).\n",
      "In 1901 in the United States, the American Can Company was founded, at the time producing 90% of the tin cans in the United States. It bought out the Sanitary Can Company of New York in 1908, and the three-piece design displaced all other cans by the early 1920s. The can saw very little change since then, although better technology brought 20% reduction in the use of steel, and 50% - in the use of tin (the modern cans are 99.5% steel).\n",
      "Canned food in tin cans was already quite popular in various countries when technological advancements in the 1920s lowered the cost of the cans even further.: 155–170, 265–280  In 1935, the first beer in metal cans was sold; it was an instant sales success.: 155–170, 265–280  The production of these three-piece cans by the American Can Company stopped for World War II due to lack of material, after the war the first two-piece cans with no side seams and a cone top were introduced. The use of aluminum started in 1958 with Primo beer.\n",
      "About 600 different types of cans were used in the early 21st century, with the most popular being the three-piece design with side seam and two doble-seamed ends, followed by the two-piece construction with sides and bottom drawn as one piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Description ==\n",
      "Most cans are right circular cylinders with identical and parallel round tops and bottoms with vertical sides. However, in cans for small volumes or particularly-shaped contents, the top and bottom may be rounded-corner rectangles or ovals. Other contents may suit a can that is somewhat conical in shape.\n",
      "Fabrication of most cans results in at least one rim—a narrow ring slightly larger than the outside diameter of the rest of the can.  The flat surfaces of rimmed cans are recessed from the edge of any rim (toward the middle of the can) by about the width of the rim; the inside diameter of a rim, adjacent to this recessed surface, is slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the rest of the can.\n",
      "Three-piece can construction results in top and bottom rims. In two-piece construction, one piece is a flat top and the other a deep-drawn cup-shaped piece that combines the (at least roughly) cylindrical wall and the round base. Transition between wall and base is usually gradual.  Such cans have a single rim at the top. Some cans have a separate cover that slides onto the top or is hinged.\n",
      "Two piece steel cans can be made by \"drawing\" to form the bottom and sides and adding an \"end\" at the top:  these do not have side seams.  Cans can be fabricated with separate slip-on, or friction fit  covers and with covers attached by hinges.  Various easy opening methods are available.\n",
      "In the mid-20th century, a few milk products were packaged in nearly rimless cans, reflecting different construction; in this case, one flat surface had a hole (for filling the nearly complete can) that was sealed after filling with a quickly solidifying drop of molten solder.  Concern arose that the milk contained unsafe levels of lead leached from this solder plug.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Advantages of steel cans ==\n",
      "A number of factors make steel cans ideal containers for beverages. Steel cans are stronger than cartons or plastic, and less fragile than glass, protecting the product in transit and preventing leakage or spillage, while also reducing the need for secondary packaging.\n",
      "Steel and aluminium packaging offer complete protection against light, water and air, and metal cans without resealable closures are among the most tamper-evident of all packaging materials. Food and drink packed in steel cans has equivalent vitamin content to freshly prepared, without needing preserving agents. Steel cans also extend the product's shelf-life, allowing longer sell-by and use-by dates and reducing waste.\n",
      "As an ambient packaging medium, steel cans do not require cooling in the supply chain, simplifying logistics and storage, and saving energy and cost. At the same time, steel's relatively high thermal conductivity means canned drinks chill much more rapidly and easily than those in glass or plastic bottles.\n",

      "=== Tin ===\n",
      "No cans currently in wide use are composed primarily or wholly of tin. Until the second half of the 20th century, almost all cans were made of tinplate steel. The steel was cheap and structurally strong, but prone to rust; the tin coating prevented the wet food from corroding the steel. Corrosion-resistant coatings on almost all steel food cans are now made from plastic, not tin. Some manufacturers use Vitreous enamel, instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Dissolution of tin into the food ====\n",
      "Tin is corrosion resistant, but acidic food like fruits and vegetables can corrode the tin layer. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported after ingesting canned food containing 200 mg/kg of tin. A 2002 study showed that 99.5% of 1200 tested cans contained below the UK regulatory limit of 200 mg/kg of tin, an improvement over most previous studies largely attributed to the increased use of fully lacquered cans for acidic foods, and concluded that the results do not raise any long term food safety concerns for consumers. The two non-compliant products were voluntarily recalled.\n",
      "Evidence of tin impurities can be indicated by color, as in the case of pears, but lack of color change does not guarantee that a food is not tainted with tin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Lead ===\n",
      "Lead is harmful to health in any quantity, and more lead is more harmful than less lead. Infants and children are more severely affected, as lead harms brain development.\n",
      "In November 1991, US can manufacturers voluntarily eliminated lead seams in food cans. Imported food cans continued to include lead soldered seams.\n",
      "In 1995, the US FDA issued a rule prohibiting lead soldered food cans, including both domestic and imported food cans. Unfortunately, the FDA did not give a definition of \"lead solder\", or a quantitative limit to permissible lead levels, and some solders and tin linings used on tin cans still contained significant amounts of lead. In 2017, quantitative limits were set, but they are high enough to permit intentionally adding lead, and the FDA measurements show measurable levels of lead in many US canned foods in the 2010s.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Plastic linings ===\n",
      "Many metal food cans are lined with plastic, to prevent the food from corroding the can. These linings can leach contaminants into the canned food. Some of these contaminants are substances with known health harms, though whether they are ingested in canned food in levels sufficient to cause harms is not known.\n",
      "Among other substances, the plastic linings in food cans often contain bisphenol A (BPA). Pregnant women who eat more canned food have higher levels of BPA in their urine.\n",
      "Other constituents in can linings, including newer BPA-free can linings, have also been identified as having known health harms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Bisphenol-A ====\n",
      "\n",
      "Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a controversial chemical compound present in commercially available tin can plastic linings and transferred to canned food. The inside of the can is coated with an epoxy coating, in an attempt to prevent food or beverage from coming into contact with the metal. The longer food is in a can, and the warmer and more acidic it is, the more BPA leaches into it. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance. In the European Union and Canada, BPA use is banned in baby bottles.\n",
      "The FDA does not regulate BPA (see BPA controversy#Public health regulatory history in the United States).  Several companies, like Campbell's Soup, announced plans to eliminate BPA from the linings of their cans, but have not said which chemical they plan to replace it with. (See BPA controversy#Chemical manufacturers reactions to bans.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Canada ====\n",
      "In 2016, BPA was common in food can linings in Canada. As of August 2008, Health Canada's Food Directorate concluded that \"the current dietary exposure to BPA through food packaging uses is not expected to pose a health risk to the general population, including newborns and infants\". They also stated that, as some animal studies had shown effects from low levels of BPA, they were seeking to make BPA levels in food packaged for infants and newborns (especially formula). They also cited a WHO review.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== UK ====\n",
      "In modern times, the majority of food cans in the UK have been lined with a plastic coating containing bisphenol A (BPA). The coating prevents acids and other substances from corroding the tin or aluminium of the can, but leaching of BPA into the cans contents was investigated as a potential health hazard. The UK Food STandards agency currently considers can-derived BPA levels to be acceptable, but is investigating its safe-level thresholds; it currently has a temporary threshold for BPS, as of 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== US ====\n",
      "A 2016 market, survey using Fourier-transform infrared spectrums to identify materials, found BPA and other substances known to have health harms were common in food can linings in the US. A similar survey done by food can manufacturers in 2020 found BPA only in some imported cans; it did not discuss potential harms from lining substances other than BPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Labels ===\n",
      "A can traditionally has a printed label glued to the outside of the curved surface, indicating its contents. Some labels contain additional information, such as recipes, on the reverse side. More recently labels are sometimes printed directly onto the metal before or after the metal sheet is formed into the individual cans.\n",
      "Traditionally, labels were glued on with casein glue, which dissolved easily in hot water. Some other glues may make the label harder to remove for recycling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Standard sizes ==\n",
      "Cans come in a variety of shapes and sizes.  Walls are often stiffened with rib bulges, especially on larger cans, to help the can resist dents that can cause seams to split.\n",
      "Can sizes in the United States have an assortment of designations and sizes. For example, size 7/8 contains one serving of half a cup with an estimated weight of 4 ounces; size 1 \"picnic\" has two or three servings totalling one and a quarter cups with an estimated weight of 101⁄2 ounces; size 303 has four servings totalling 2 cups weighing 151⁄2 ounces; and size 10 cans, most widely used by food services selling to cafeterias and restaurants, have twenty-five servings totalling 13 cups with an estimated weight of 1031⁄2 ounces (size of a roughly 3 pound coffee can). These are U.S. customary cups, not British Imperial standard.\n",
      "In the United States, cook books sometimes reference cans by size. The Can Manufacturers Institute defines these sizes, expressing them in three-digit numbers, as measured in whole and sixteenths of an inch for the container's nominal outside dimensions: a 307 × 512 would thus measure 3 and 7/16\" in diameter by 5 and 3/4\" (12/16\") in height. Older can numbers are often expressed as single digits, their contents being calculated for room-temperature water as approximately eleven ounces (#1 \"picnic\" can), twenty ounces (#2), thirty-two ounces (#3), fifty-eight ounces (#5), and one-hundred-ten ounces (#10 \"coffee\" can).\n",
      "\n",
      "In parts of the world using the metric system, tins are made in 250, 500, 750 ml (millilitre) and 1 L (litre) sizes (250 ml is approximately 1 cup or 8 ounces).  Cans imported from the US often have odd sizes such as 3.8 L (1 US gallon), 1.9 L (1/2 US gallon), and 946 ml (2 US pints / 1 quart).\n",
      "In the UK and Australia, cans are usually measured by net weight. A standard size tin can holds roughly 400 g; though the weight can vary between 385 g and 425 g depending on the density of the contents. The smaller half sized can holds roughly 200 g, typically varying between 170 g and 225 g.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Fabrication of cans ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Rimmed three-piece can construction involves several stages;\n",
      "\n",
      "Forming a tube and welding or soldering the seam of the sides\n",
      "Joining the bottom end to the tube\n",
      "Printing or attaching labels to the can\n",
      "Filling the can with content;  sterilization or retorting is required for many food products\n",
      "Joining the wall and top \"end\".\n",
      "Double seam rims are crucial to the joining of the wall to a top or bottom surface. An extremely tight fit between the pieces must be accomplished to prevent leakage; the process of accomplishing this radically deforms the rims of the parts. Part of the tube that forms the wall is bent, almost at its end, turning outward through 90 degrees, and then bent further, toward the middle of the tube, until it is parallel to the rest of the tube, a total bend of 180 degrees.\n",
      "The outer edge of the flat piece is bent against this toward the middle of the tubular wall, until parallel with the wall, turning inward through 90 degrees.  The edge of bent portion is bent further through another 90 degrees, inward now toward the axis of the tube and parallel to the main portion of the flat piece, making a total bend of 180 degrees. It is bent far enough inward that its circular edge is now slightly smaller in diameter than the edge of the tube. Bending it yet further, until it is parallel with the tube's axis, gives it a total bend of 270 degrees. It now envelops the outward rim of the tube.\n",
      "Looking outward from the axis of the tube, the first surface is the unbent portion of the tube. Slightly further out is a narrow portion of the top, including its edge. The outward-bent portion of the tube, including its edge, is still slightly further out. Furthest out is the 90-degree-bent portion of the flat surface.\n",
      "The combined interacting forces, as the portion of the flat surface adjacent to the interior of the tube is indented toward the middle of the tube and then outward forward the axis of the tube, and the other bent portions of the flat piece and the tube are all forced toward the axis of the tube, drives these five thicknesses of metal against each other from inside and out, forming a \"dry\" joint so tight that welding or solder is not needed to strengthen or seal it. Illustrations of this process can be found on pages 20–22 of the FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 285 \"Manual on fish canning\".\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Two-piece steel can design ===\n",
      "Most steel beverage cans are two-piece designs, made from 1) a disc re-formed into a cylinder with an integral end, double-seamed after filling and 2) a loose end to close it. Steel cans are made in many different diameters and volumes, with opening mechanisms that vary from ring pulls and tab openers, to wide open mouths.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Drawn-and-ironed (DWI) steel cans ===\n",
      "The process of re-forming sheet metal without changing its thickness is known as 'drawing'. Thinning the walls of a two-piece can by passing it through circular dies is called 'ironing'. Steel beverage cans are therefore generally referred to as drawn-and-ironed, or DWI, cans (sometimes D&I). The DWI process is used for making cans where the height is greater than the diameter, and is particularly suited to making large volumes of cans of the same basic specification.\n",
      "Steel can wall thicknesses are now 30% thinner and weigh 40% less than 30 years ago, reducing the amounts of raw materials and energy required to make them. They are also up to 40% thinner than aluminium.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Magnetic properties ===\n",
      "Steel is a ferrous metal and is therefore magnetic. For beverage packaging this is unique. This allows the use of magnetic conveyor systems to transfer empty cans through the filling and packing processes, increasing accuracy and reducing potential spillage and waste. In recycling facilities, steel cans may be readily separated from other waste using magnetic equipment including cross-belt separators, also known as overband magnets, and drum magnets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Opening cans ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The first cans were heavy-weight containers that required ingenuity to open, with instructions directing to use a hammer and chisel, during the war of 1812, British soldiers resorted to use of bayonets and knives. After an introduction of much thinner cans in 1850s, a specialized opener became possible, and were introduced in 1855 (Robert Yeates) and 1858 (Ezra J. Warner). The latter unwieldy design saw limited use by soldiers in the American Civil War. The push-lever opener similar to the modern ones was introduced in 1860 (\"Bull's Head\"), cutting wheel invented in 1870 (William W. Lyman). Serrated wheel, common in the rotating can openers, was first used by the Star Can Opener Company in 1925.  \n",
      "While beverage cans or cans of liquid such as broth can be punctured—as with a church key—to pour out the contents, solid or semisolid contents require removing one end of the can. This can be accomplished with a heavy knife or other sharp tool, but can openers are safer, easier, and more convenient.\n",
      "Some cans, such as those used for sardines, have a specially scored lid so that the user can break out the metal by the leverage of winding it around a slotted twist-key. Until the mid-20th century, some sardine tins had solder-attached lids, and the twist-key worked by forcing the solder joint apart.\n",
      "The advent of pull tabs in beverage cans spread to the canning of various food products, such as pet food or nuts (and non-food products such as motor oil and tennis balls). The ends are known as easy open lids because they open without any tools or implements. An additional innovation developed specifically for food cans uses a tab that is bent slightly upwards, creating a larger surface area for easier finger access.\n",
      "Cans can be made with easy open features. Some cans have screw caps for pouring liquids and resealing.  Some have hinged covers or slip-on covers for easy access. Paint cans usually have a lid with an interference fit, removable and replaceable any number of times so the paint may be stored between uses.\n",

      "Steel from cans and other sources is the most recycled packaging material. Around 65% of steel cans are recycled. In the United States, 63% of steel cans are recycled, compared to 52% of aluminium cans. In Europe, the recycling rate in 2016 is 79.5%.\n",

      "==== Steel recycling ====\n",
      "\n",
      "From an ecological perspective, steel may be regarded as a closed-loop material: post-consumer waste can be collected, recycled and used to make new cans or other products. Each tonne of scrap steel recycled saves 1.5 tonnes of CO2, 1.4 tonnes of iron ore and 740 kg of coal. Steel is the world's most recycled material, with more than 85% of all the world's steel products being recycled at the end of their life: an estimated 630 million tonnes of steel scrap were recycled in 2017, saving 945 million tonnes of CO2.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Steel can recycling ====\n",
      "A steel can can be recycled again and again without loss of quality; however, for the food grade steel it's required to remove tin from the scrap metal, which is done by way of electrochemistry: the tin is leached from a high pH solution at low negative voltage.\n",
      "Recycling a single can saves the equivalent power for one laundry load, 1 hour of TV or 24 hours of lighting (10W LED bulb).\n",
      "Steel beverage cans are recycled by being melted down in an electric arc furnace or basic oxygen furnace.\n",
      "Most steel cans also carry some form of recycling identification such as the Metal Recycles Forever Mark  Recyclable Steel  and the Choose Steel campaign logo. There is also a campaign in Europe called Every Can Counts, encouraging can recycling in the workplace \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Smaller carbon footprint ====\n",
      "All beverage packaging creates CO2 emissions at every stage in the production process, from raw material extraction, processing and manufacture through to recycling. However, steel cans are an ecological top performer, as cans can always be recycled. The steel industry needs the used cans and will use them in the production of new steel product. By recycling the cans and closing the loop, CO2 emissions are dramatically reduced. There is also the potential for higher global steel recycling rates as consumers become more aware of the benefits.\n",

      "A waste container, also known as a dustbin, rubbish bin, trash can, and garbage can, among other names, is a type of container intended to store waste that is usually made out of metal or plastic. The words \"rubbish\", \"basket\" and \"bin\" are more common in British English usage; \"trash\" and \"can\" are more common in American English usage. \"Garbage\" may refer to food waste specifically (when distinguished from \"trash\") or to municipal solid waste in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Designs ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Trash cans are typically made of steel or plastic (most commonly polyethylene), although some are made of wood or wicker.\n",
      "A pedal bin is a container with a lid operated by a foot pedal. Lillian Moller Gilbreth, an industrial engineer and efficiency expert, invented the pedal bin in the 1920s for the disposal of kitchen waste. The foot pedal enables the user to open the lid without touching it with their hands.\n",
      "In the 2010s, some bins have begun to include automated mechanisms such as a lid with infrared detection on the top of the can powered by batteries to open it rather than a foot pedal, freeing the user from touching the bin in any way. This helps prevent the bin lids becoming clogged with trash. These wastes containers are mostly made of stainless steel. Some bin models also include a small receptable for an air freshener.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Origins ==\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== French ===\n",
      "Legislation surrounding waste receptacles was first introduced in France in an 1883 prefectural order signed by Eugène Poubelle, from whose name the French word for a waste receptacle comes. This order mandated the provision and collection of waste bins to each household in Paris. These bins were specified as having to be between 80 and 120 litres in volume and having a handle and a lid. Three waste bins were to be allocated to each household in order to sort refuse from reclaimable fibres such as paper and cloth and other reusable materials like ceramics, glasses and oyster shells.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== English ===\n",
      "Legislation setting out the responsibilities for the provision and collection of \"receptacles for the temporary deposit and collection of dust ashes and rubbish\" by local authorities in Britain was first set out in the Public Health Act 1875. However, this did not mandate the use of them, leaving the decision to offer the service to local government instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Household collection ==\n",
      "\n",
      "In many cities and towns, there is a public waste collection service which regularly collects household waste from outside buildings. The waste is loaded into a garbage truck and driven to a landfill, incinerator or crush facility to be disposed of.\n",
      "In some areas, each household has multiple bins for different categories of rubbish (usually represented by colours) depending on its suitability for recycling, which will instead be routed to a recycling center.\n",
      "Roadside waste collection is often done by means of larger metal containers of varying designs, mostly called dumpsters in the US, and skips in the UK. However the functionality dumpsters and skips are somewhat different: while a skip is intended to be loaded onto a vehicle and transported, the contents of a dumpster are emptied into a garbage truck on site and the dumpster remains and its designated location. Adding to this, there is another type of container known as a Roll Off Dumpster. This type is unique because it's designed for easy transportation and disposal of large amounts of waste. Roll Off Dumpsters are set on a truck with a roll-off mechanism, allowing them to be rolled onto and off the truck bed. This feature makes them particularly useful for large projects like construction, renovation, or extensive clean-ups where substantial amounts of waste are generated. They come in various sizes to accommodate different needs, and unlike regular dumpsters, they are open-topped for easier loading of large or irregularly shaped debris. Their mobility and capacity for handling heavy loads make them an efficient solution for large-scale waste management. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Public collection ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Public areas such as parks, often have litter bins placed to improve the social environment by encouraging people not to litter. Such bins in outdoor locations or other busy public areas are usually mounted to the ground or wall to discourage theft, and reduce vandalism, and to improve their appearance are sometimes deliberately artistic or cute. In dense urban areas, trash is stored underground below the receptacle. Many are lined with a plastic or paper bin bag to help contain liquids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Metaphors ==\n",
      "The term \"garbage can\" is also used for a model of decision making, the \"Garbage Can Model\" of decision making. It is concerned with cases of decision making in great aggregate uncertainty which can cause decisions to arise that from a distant point of view might seem irrational.\n",
      "A \"trash can\" metaphor is often used in computer operating system desktop environments as a place files can be moved for deletion.\n",
      "In a workplace setting, a bin may be euphemistically called \"the circular file\", \"the round file\" or \"the janitor's file\". Whereas useful documents are filed in a filing cabinet, which is rectangular, junk mail and other worthless items are \"filed\" in the bin, which is often round.\n",
      "The term \"wastebasket\" is occasionally used in taxonomy to refer to less formal (and often paraphyletic) groupings that pose problems in classification (e.g., the proposed order Insectivora is considered a \"wastebasket taxon\", as it groups small mammals that do not fit nicely into other taxa), and the Nilo-Saharan language family is sometimes called \"Greenberg's wastebasket\", as it was a grouping made by him to fit the languages of Africa that did not fall into the other groups, Afroasiatic, Niger–Congo and Khoisan.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Construction ==\n",
      "A wide variety of container types and constructions are used for fuels.  Each has its own engineering challenges.\n",
      "The jerrycan is a robust liquid container originally made from pressed steel. It was designed in Germany in the 1930s for military use to hold 20 litres (4.4 imp gal; 5.3 US gal) of fuel.  Three handles allow for two people carrying a full can or one person handling an empty can.  The basic design is still in use today although construction is often of high density polyethylene.\n",
      "Portable plastic gasoline containers are commercially available and are in common use.  These are usually blow molded polyethylene or other polymers compatible with the designated fuel.  It has been found that the use of flame arresters reduces the chance of fire or explosion of gasoline.  Child resistant caps or closures are required in some regions or jurisdictions.\n",
      "A drum (also called a barrel) is a cylindrical container used for shipping fuels. A typical drum has a nominal capacity of 200 litres (55 US or 44 imp gal). Drums are usually made of steel, but plastic drums are used for some liquids. Fuel drums need have the appropriate certification for shipment of dangerous goods: Flammable liquids, etc. Steel drums are suited for reconditioning for multiple uses.\n",

      "== Grounding ==\n",
      "Pouring of a flammable liquid has the potential of generating static electricity.  Having the fuel container on the ground or having a grounding strap helps reduce the risk of sparks.

      "Can were a German experimental rock band formed in Cologne in 1968 by Holger Czukay (bass, tape editing), Irmin Schmidt (keyboards), Michael Karoli (guitar), and Jaki Liebezeit (drums). They featured several vocalists, including the American Malcolm Mooney (1968–70) and the Japanese Damo Suzuki (1970–73). They have been hailed as pioneers of the German krautrock scene.\n",
      "The founding members of Can came from backgrounds in avant-garde music and jazz. They blended elements of psychedelic rock, funk, and musique concrète on influential albums such as Tago Mago (1971), Ege Bamyasi (1972) and Future Days (1973). Can also had commercial success with singles such as \"Spoon\" (1971) and \"I Want More\" (1976) reaching national singles charts. Their work has influenced rock, post-punk, and ambient acts.\n",

      "\n",
      "Can was formed in Cologne, Germany, in 1968 by Holger Czukay (bass), Irmin Schmidt (keyboard), Jaki Liebezeit (drums) and Michael Karoli (guitar). Czukay and Schmidt were from academic backgrounds, students of the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, and were fascinated by the possibilities of rock and roll. The band initially used the name Inner Space.\n",
      "In late 1968, the band enlisted the American vocalist Malcolm Mooney. They recorded an album, Prepare to Meet Thy Pnoom, but could not find a recording company to release it. They appeared briefly in the 1969 film Kamasutra: Vollendung der Liebe backing the singer Margarete Juvan.\n",
      "At Mooney's suggestion, the band changed their name to Can. Mooney suggested the name for its positive meanings in various languages. Liebezeit later suggested the backronym \"communism, anarchism, nihilism\", after an English magazine claimed this was the intended meaning.\n",
      "Can accepted an invitation from a friend to move into his castle, Schloss Nörvenich, and use it as a recording studio. There, they recorded their debut album, Monster Movie (1969). It contained new versions of two songs previously recorded for Prepared to Meet Thy Pnoom, \"Father Cannot Yell\" and \"Outside My Door\". Monster Movie received acclaim. \n",
      "During one live performance, Mooney suffered a mental breakdown, shouting \"upstairs, downstairs\" for three hours, even after Can had stopped playing. On his psychiatrist's advice, he left Can and returned to the US at the end of 1969. Mooney made his last recordings with Can that December. He was replaced in 1970 by a young Japanese traveller, Damo Suzuki, whom Czukay and Liebezeit found  busking outside a Munich café and invited to join their performance that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 1971–1973 ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The next few years saw Can release their most acclaimed works. While their earlier recordings were loosely based on traditional song structures, Can band reverted to a fluid improvisational style. The double album Tago Mago (1971) is often seen as groundbreaking, influential and deeply unconventional, based on intensely rhythmic jazz-inspired drumming, improvised guitar and keyboard soloing (frequently intertwining), tape edits as composition, and Suzuki's idiosyncratic vocalisms. Czukay said it \"was an attempt in achieving a mystery musical world from light to darkness and return\".\n",
      "In 1971 the band composed the music for the three-part German-language television crime miniseries Das Messer (\"The Knife\"), directed by Rolf von Sydow. The track \"Spoon\" was used as the theme song and, released as a single, reached number 6 in the German singles chart.\n",
      "Tago Mago was followed in 1972 by Ege Bamyasi, a more accessible but still avant-garde record which featured \"Spoon\" and the catchy \"Vitamin C\".  Czukay said, \"We could achieve an excellent dry and ambient sound... [Ege Bamyasi] reflects the group being in a lighter mood.\"\n",
      "It was followed by Future Days in 1973, an early example of ambient music that also includes the pop song \"Moonshake\". Czukay said, \"'Bel Air' [the 20-minute track that takes up all of side two on the original Future Days LP] showed Can in a state of being an electric symphony group performing a peaceful though sometimes dramatic landscape painting.\"\n",
      "Suzuki left soon after the recording of Future Days to marry his German girlfriend, and become a Jehovah's Witness. Vocals were taken over by Karoli and Schmidt, but after Suzuki's departure, fewer of Can's tracks featured vocals, as the band experimented with the ambient music it had begun with Future Days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 1974–1979 ===\n",
      "Soon Over Babaluma from 1974 continued in the ambient style of Future Days, but with some of the abrasive edge of Tago Mago and Ege Bamyasi. In 1975, Can signed with Virgin Records in the UK and EMI/Harvest in West Germany, appearing the same year on BBC's Old Grey Whistle Test in a memorable performance of Vernal Equinox in which Schmidt played one keyboard section with a series of rapid karate chops. Shortly after the appearance Schmidt suffered a broken leg which led to cancellation of the band's UK tour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The later albums Landed (1975) and Flow Motion (1976) saw Can moving towards a somewhat more conventional style as its recording technology improved. The disco single \"I Want More\" from Flow Motion became its only hit record outside West Germany. Co-written by live sound mixer Peter Gilmour, it reached No 26 in the UK charts in October 1976, which prompted an appearance on Top of the Pops, where Czukay performed with a double bass. In 1977 Can was joined by former Traffic bassist Rosko Gee and percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah, both of whom provided vocals, appearing on the albums Saw Delight (1977), Out of Reach (1978) and Can (1979).\n",
      "During this period Czukay was pushed to the fringes of the group's activity due to disagreements about the band's creative direction and his failure as a bass guitarist to keep up with the growth of the other musicians. Bass guitar was something Czukay had \"taken up almost by default\" and he readily admitted his limitations on the instrument. After Gee joined Can, Czukay made sounds using shortwave radios, Morse code keys, tape recorders and other sundry objects. He left Can in late 1977 and did not appear on the albums Out of Reach or Can, although he was involved with production work for the latter album.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== After the split and reunion ===\n",
      "After the split, all the former members were involved in musical projects, often as session musicians for other artists. Czukay recorded several ambient albums and collaborated with David Sylvian among others. Jaki Liebezeit played extensively with bassists Jah Wobble and Bill Laswell, with a drum ensemble called Drums off Chaos and in 2005 with Datenverarbeiter on the online album Givt.\n",
      "In 1986 they briefly reformed, with original vocalist Mooney, to record Rite Time (released in 1989).  There was a further reunion in 1991 by Karoli, Liebezeit, Mooney and Schmidt to record a track for the Wim Wenders film Until the End of the World and in August 1999 by Karoli, Liebezeit and Schmidt with Jono Podmore to record a cover of \"The Third Man Theme\" for Grönland Records' compilation album Pop 2000. In 1999 the four core members of Can: Karoli, Liebezeit, Schmidt and Czukay, performed live at the same show, although playing separately with their current solo projects (Sofortkontakt, Club Off Chaos, Kumo and U-She respectively). Can have since been the subject of numerous compilations, live albums and samples. In 2004, the band began a series of Super Audio CD remasters of its back catalog, which were finished in 2006.\n",
      "Karoli died of cancer on 17 November 2001; Liebezeit died of pneumonia on 22 January 2017; Czukay died of natural causes on 5 September 2017; and Suzuki died of cancer in February 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Archive releases ==\n",
      "Can released a compilation album Limited Edition in 1974, and expanded it to a double album Unlimited Edition in 1976 from their unreleased studio recordings. Delay 1968, released in 1981, was a compilation of unreleased 1968–1969 recordings. Cannibalism 2, a compilation album of album and single material, also included one unreleased song, \"Melting Away\", from the 1960s.\n",
      "In 1995 The Peel Sessions was released, a compilation of Can recordings at the BBC. In 1999 Can Box was released, with a Can video documentary, a concert recording from 1972 and a double live CD compiled by Michael Karoli and later released separately as Can Live Music (Live 1971–1977). Unreleased live music of Can have been also released on the 40th Anniversary Edition of Tago Mago in 2011 and 17 LP collection box Can in 2014.\n",
      "The Lost Tapes, released in 2012, was overseen by Irmin Schmidt and Daniel Miller, compiled by Schmidt and Jono Podmore, and edited by Podmore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Style ==\n",
      "Can developed a repetitive, rhythmic style with influences of North African music, Stockhausen, and American minimalists such as Steve Reich and Terry Riley. Czukay and Schmidt were both pupils of Stockhausen, and Can inherited a grounding in his musical theory. Schmidt was trained as a classical pianist, while Karoli brought the influence of gypsy music through his esoteric studies. Liebezeit had strong jazz leanings. The band's sound was originally intended to be based on the sound of ethnic music, so when the band decided to pick up the garage rock sound, original member David Johnson left. This world music trend was later exemplified on albums such as Ege Bamyasi (the name meaning \"Aegean okra\" in Turkish), Future Days and Saw Delight, and by incorporating new band members with different nationalities. A series of tracks on Can albums, known as \"Ethnological Forgery Series\", abbreviated to \"E.F.S\", demonstrated the band's ability to successfully recreate ethnic-sounding music. They constructed their music largely through collective spontaneous composition, sampling themselves in the studio and editing down the results. Czukay referred to Can's live and studio performances as \"instant compositions\".\n",
      "The band's early rock influences include the Beatles and the Velvet Underground as well as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Frank Zappa. The band have admitted that the beginning of Can's \"Father Cannot Yell\" was inspired by the Velvet Underground's \"European Son\". Malcolm Mooney's voice has been compared to that of James Brown (an acknowledged hero of the band members) and their early style, rooted in psychedelic music, drew comparisons with Pink Floyd. Czukay's extensive editing has occasionally been compared to the late-'60s music of trumpeter Miles Davis (such as In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew): Can and Davis both would record long groove-intensive improvisations, then edit the best bits together for their albums. Czukay and Teo Macero (Davis's producer and editor) both had roots in the musique concrète of the 1940s and '50s. Irmin Schmidt stated in a discussion with Michael Karoli in 1996 concerning the various citations of influences upon their music: \"You know, it's funny that in spite of all the supposed influences on us that have been written about, the one overriding influence has never been mentioned: Michael von Biel.\"\n",
      "Suzuki was a very different singer from Mooney, with a multilingual (he claimed to sing in \"the language of the Stone Age\") and often inscrutable vocal style. With Suzuki, the band made their most critically and commercially successful albums. The rhythm section's work on Tago Mago has been especially praised: one critic writes that much of the album is based on \"long improvisations built around hypnotic rhythm patterns\"; another writes that \"Halleluhwah\" finds them \"pounding out a monster trance/funk beat\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Improvisation, recording and live shows ===\n",
      "Much of Can's music was based on free improvisation and then edited for the studio albums. For example, when preparing a soundtrack, only Irmin Schmidt would view the film and then give the rest of the band a general description of the scenes they would be scoring. This assisted in the improvised soundtrack being successful both inside and outside the film's context.\n",
      "Can's live shows often melded spontaneous improvisation of this kind with songs appearing on their albums. The track \"Colchester Finale\", appearing on the Can Live album, incorporates portions of \"Halleluhwah\" into a composition lasting over half an hour. Early concerts found Mooney and Suzuki often able to shock audiences. The actor David Niven was asked by Czukay what he had thought of a concert, Niven replied: \"It was great, but I didn't know it was music.\" After the departure of Suzuki, the music grew in intensity without a vocal centre. The band maintained their ability to collectively improvise with or without central themes for hours at a time (their longest performance, in Berlin, lasted over six hours), resulting in a large archive of performances.\n",
      "Can made attempts to find a new vocalist after the departure of Damo Suzuki, although no one quite fit the position. In 1975, folk singer Tim Hardin took the lead vocal spot and played guitar with Can for one song, at two gigs, performing his own \"The Lady Came From Baltimore\". Malaysian vocalist Thaiga Raj Raja Ratnam played six dates with the band between January and March 1976. Another temporary vocalist, Englishman Michael Cousins, toured with Can from March (France) to April (West Germany) 1976.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Legacy and influence ==\n",
      "In the late 1970s, Can influenced major artists working in the post-punk genre such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Fall, Public Image Ltd and Joy Division. In the 1980s, Can were referenced by British new wave acts such as Pete Shelley, Gary Numan, Ultravox, the Jesus and Mary Chain and Primal Scream. The Lumerians and Happy Mondays have cited Can as an influence. Critic Simon Reynolds wrote that \"Can's pan-global avant-funk anticipated many of the moves made by sampladelic dance genres like trip hop, ethnotechno and ambient jungle.\" Brian Eno made a short film in tribute to Can, while John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers appeared at the Echo Awards ceremony, at which Can were awarded the most prestigious music award in Germany. \n",
      "Radiohead cited Can as an influence on their albums Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). Inspired by Can, they constructed their own studio and worked by recording jams and then editing the recordings. Radiohead covered \"The Thief\" in live performances in the early 2000s. Mark E. Smith of the Fall paid tribute to Suzuki with the track \"I Am Damo Suzuki\" on the 1985 album This Nation's Saving Grace. The Jesus and Mary Chain covered \"Mushroom\" live in the mid-1980s. Mark Hollis of Talk Talk had mentioned Can several times as an influence for their later albums, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. \n",
      "At least five notable bands have named themselves in tribute to Can: the Mooney Suzuki for Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki; the indie rock band Spoon after the hit \"Spoon\"; the electronic band Egebamyasi, formed by Scottish musician Mr Egg in 1984, after Can's album Ege Bamyasi; Hunters & Collectors after a song on the Landed album; and Moonshake, named for a track on Future Days, and formed by ex-Wolfhounds frontman David Callahan. The Scottish writer Alan Warner has written two novels in tribute to two different Can members (Morvern Callar to Holger Czukay and The Man Who Walks to Michael Karoli respectively). The Sacrilege remix album features remixes of Can tracks by artists who were influenced by Can, including Sonic Youth and U.N.K.L.E. Their ethnomusicological tendencies pre-date the craze for world music in the 1980s. While not nearly as influential on electronic music as Kraftwerk, they were important early pioneers of ambient music, along with Tangerine Dream and the aforementioned band. Many groups working in the post-rock genre can look to Can as an influence as part of the larger krautrock scene, as can New Prog bands such as The Mars Volta. Rolling Stone called the group a \"pioneering space rock band\". Kanye West has sampled \"Sing Swan Song\" on his song \"Drunk & Hot Girls\" from his 2007 album Graduation. The UK band Loop was deeply influenced by Can for their repetitive polyrhythmic style, covering Can's \"Mother Sky\" on their Black Sun EP. The Yugoslav progressive/psychedelic rock band Igra Staklenih Perli, heavily influenced by Can, on their self-titled debut album released the song \"Pečurka\" (\"Mushroom\") as a tribute to Can.\n",
      "The band is name-checked as a formative influence in LCD Soundsystem's debut single \"Losing My Edge\". Oasis' 2008 single \"The Shock of the Lightning\" was inspired by Can and Neu!.\n",
      "The Japanese psych/krautrock band Minami Deutsch is heavily influenced by Can, and band member Kyotaro Mitula performed with Damo Suzuki at the Roadburn Festival.\n",
